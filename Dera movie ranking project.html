<h1>The Best Movies According to Dera</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>This is my forever best series because of all the action packed in it.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
Another of my favourite series. Action packed and very good story line.<br />
However, the diverification of Power brought about a sudden lack of interest.

<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>This is my all time favourite British movie.</p>
