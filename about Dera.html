<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jeremiah Ebulue and i am the owner of this website. I come from a somewhat large family consisting 
  of four(4) boys and two(2) girls. I am the fourth child of my parents and the most anyhow of them.
  Well here i am suppose to tell you all about myself but currently i lack what to say, i hope that as time goes 
  on tho i'll be able to fill this place up and be a lot more productive.
</p>

<p>One thing i can say now is about my dreams, i want to make this website a very popular one. Such that it passes 
  very useful informations, such that will benefit humans and impact positively in their lives. But for now i have 
  direction concerning where this website is currently headed. 
</p>

<p>Thanks for taking your time to read to the end, I hope you keep checking back to monitor my progress.</p>
